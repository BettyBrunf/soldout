			<p id="ph">We started this project on the simple observation of a lack of variety of ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation and ability in the canons, referees and sometimes representation of Graphic Design.</p>

			<p>Most importantly it came from an urgency to understand WHY and how to break this system of referencing in Graphic Design down.</p>

			<p>When we started to investigate, we found it was quite challenging to find these references we were looking for (and questioned whether they even existed). Where are the Audre Lorde, the Bell Hooks and Paolo Freire of Graphic Design? There is no doubt that they exist but why were we never introduced to them? Other fields outside of Graphic Design seem to be more advanced in this process of bringing in a wider variety of voices and perspectives into their field and rethinking their ways and systems (such as decolonisation, feminism processes, etc). We’ve thought of adapting their models, creating toolkits, searching for a way to bring about a system that could be more efficient to reference more inclusively...</p>

			<p>This is how  we came to decide to publish these references ourselves or better, to facilitate their existence under the name of Sold Out. We wish to create a platform with Sold Out that hopes to bring a wide variety of sources, aesthetics, designs, theories and practices to this conversation.</p>

			<p>We publish content that often gets overlooked and under referenced in academic and practical spaces within Graphic Design and Visual Communication - aiming to challenge aesthetics, theory and the practice. We hope to bring together perspectives that diversify the realm of visual culture. Our tagline, "We're sold out but you can be too.” - is both an invitation and a provocation that the published content either fails to come to existence at the moment or doesn’t get the attention it deserves. Our intention is to expand, broaden the referees of Graphic design and question how we categorise, label and prioritise our references at the moment. We want to challenge the consensus and re-define it by collaborating with a wider group of people. Our whole objective is to make this a conscious activity within Graphic Design, it’s not just a byproduct, or a value that we stand by - it’s our main goal. Distribution will thus be a very important matter, ranging from our ecommerce, museum shops and directly art and design school libraries.</p>

			<p id="author">The definition of a model is a standard or an example for imitation. We wish to introduce you to references and referees - authors and content  we believe should be of the same standard. Creating models that coexist in the industry with the existing ones. Some of the work we introduce here is finished while others are prospective/speculative titles - in need for an author.</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<p id="model">The main objective with Sold Out is to facilitate as many perspectives, narratives, stories, theories that are unreferenced and overlooked. In that we take our responsibility very dearly in terms of keeping our values true to our main objective of being inclusive and at the same time evolving our concept of what inclusivity means. We encourage everyone to be a part of these conversations and keep questioning the criteria. You don’t need a PHD or to be a regular on It’s Nice That to be a part of Sold Out; we only care about your content and what you have to say. When working with our authors we believe in full collaboration with them on the basis of mutual trust. Making their project happen is the core of our integrity.</p>
			<p>Our whole process is based on Collaboration, opening-up discussions and questioning the current value systems and how they are built. We are looking at more democratic systems regarding the descision making and distribution.
